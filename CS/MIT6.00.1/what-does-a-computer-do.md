## Introduction

计算机科学及编程导论在 MIT 的课程编号是 6.00.1，是计算机科学及工程学院的经典课程。之前，课程一直使用 Scheme 作为教学语言，不过由于 Python 简单、易学等原因，近年来已经改用 Python 作为教学语言了。[更多介绍](http://codingpy.com/article/mit-ocw-introduction-computer-science-using-python/)

## What does a computer do?

* Fundamentally a computer:
  * Performs some calculations
  * Remembers results

* What calculations?
  * Built in primitives
  * Creating our own methods of calculating

Simple calculations are not enough, so good algorithm design also needed to accomplish a task.

Despite its speed and storage, a computer does have limitations

* Some problems still too complex
* Some problems are fundamentally impossible to computer (e.g. Turing's Halting Problem)

---

## Knowledge

* Declarative
* Imperative (likes a recipe, "how-to")

## Computers

* Fixed-program computers (earliest computers): To solve specific problems
  * Atanasoff (1941) - linear equations
  * Turing bombe
* Stored-program computers

* Program is a recipe. Each programming language provides a set of primitive operations.
* Given a fixed set of primitives, a good programmer can program anything.
* Anything you can do with a language, you can do with another.

## About python

* High(√) vs. Low
* General(√) vs. Targetted
* Interpreted(√) vs. Compiled

## Aspects of languages & Common Errors

| Aspects | Description |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Primitive constructs | numbers, strings, simple operators |
| Syntax | which strings of charactres and symbols are well-formed |
| Static semantics | which syntactically valid strings have a meaning |
| Full semantics | what is the meaning associated with a syntactically correct string of symbols with no static semantic errors |

* 语法用来描述语言中，什么表述是合法的。 
* 静态语义表示什么程序是有意义的，哪种表达是有意义的。 
* 完整语义即程序想达到什么目的，运行程序会产生什么效果。

## Goal

* Learn the syntax and semantics of a programming language.
* Learn how to use those elements to translate “recipes” for solving a problem into a form that the computer can use to do the work for us.
* **Computational modes of thought enable us to use a suite of methods to solve problems.**
